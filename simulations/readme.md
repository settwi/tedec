# Simulations
Here are a few different simulations of data applied to the temporal decomposition technique.
The more developed version is in `simpler`.

## Simpler simulations
- Located in `simpler`
- Only the emission measure and electron flux are time-varying.
- Three situations: typical flare, strong nonthermal, strong thermal.
- Files are output by each notebook for processing later on if desired.
- The files are pickles of fitting objects and some .png images.

## More complex simulations
- These are half-baked and have a more complex setup
- Every flare parameter changes across time
- Some are coupled, (e.g. temperature ~ integral of electron flux)
