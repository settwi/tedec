# simulations
## step 1
### basic.ipynb
- "typical" flare with both strong thermal/nonthermal component
- has photon decomposition with a simple background (constant + lines)
- things seem to work when we have lots of counts.
    - when do things start to fail?
    - how few counts is reasonable?
    - how many time bins do we need?

## next steps
- ~~add uncertainty to the basic simulation data (sample the photons before adding bkg)~~
- do the basic simulation using a spectral response matrix---might help because high-E stuff gets pushed to lower E, maybe helping discriminate more
- do the other flare categories the reviewer requested
    - weak nonthermal
    - strong non-thermal (cold flare)
- clarify count/photon thresholds
