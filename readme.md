# Temporal decomposition
Code for decomposing spectrograms using timing information.
Could be e.g. (E, t) spectrograms.
Or some other kind of physically motivated connection.

## Installation
1. Set up Python somehow (I recommend using a virtual environment via [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)).
2. `cd` into this directory and install the package: `uv pip install .`

## How to use: see the examples in `examples`!
